## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

- Graceful degradation is a strategy that ensures a web application remains functional with limited features when newer technologies fail. Service workers, integral to progressive web apps, allow applications to function offline by caching content and handling network requests. Thus, service workers support graceful degradation by providing fallback mechanisms that maintain user experience during connectivity issues or when certain technologies are unsupported.
